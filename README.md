** When you look at the demo, please replace the following with a comment dealing with duplicate values **
'''    !!! IMPORTANT!!!
The data subjects are the same but match to different unique attribute values. 
This situation is mostly seen in change dimension tables in data warehouses, where the subject of the same fact table matches multiple values of the same attribute
 Because the sample is less than 1000 after removing the duplicates values and to get a better model,
 only the code is shown here without removing the duplicate values'''
